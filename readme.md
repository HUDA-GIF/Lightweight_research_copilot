ðŸ“š Lightweight Research Copilot (Optimized)

An interactive Streamlit web app that helps researchers, students, and knowledge workers summarize text and generate quizzes.
It supports both fast extractive summarization (using NLTK + TextRank) and advanced abstractive summarization (using transformer models via Hugging Face).

âœ¨ Features

Summarization Methods

âš¡ Fast (Extractive): Uses NLTK + NetworkX TextRank for quick results.

ðŸ¤– Advanced (Transformer): Uses facebook/bart-large-cnn for summarization and deepset/minilm-uncased-squad2 for Q&A.

Quiz Generation

Automatically generates comprehension questions from the summarized text.

Supports both generic question sets and QA-model-generated questions.

Performance Monitoring

Displays estimated processing time, memory usage, and model status.

Fallback Handling

Works even if transformers is not installed or system memory is limited.

Automatically downloads required NLTK resources (punkt, stopwords).
